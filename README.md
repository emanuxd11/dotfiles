# Welcome to my dotfiles!

I created this repository mainly for personal use, but obviously I don't mind if people want to take a look and get some ideas (or even give me some!).

I feel it's important to mention that I am not using standard [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and [st](https://st.suckless.org/), but rather [dwm-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch) and [st-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/st-flexipatch), created by [bakkeby](https://github.com/bakkeby). These are some phenomenal work and they make it really easy to try out different patches, especially if you're like me and you don't have the patience/time/confidence that you're not gonna break something needed to patch everything manually.

I am also using [dwmbar](https://github.com/thytom/dwmbar) by [thytom](https://github.com/thytom) to get my custom status bar.
